This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in Python when calculating the average of a list of numbers: the `ZeroDivisionError` that occurs when an empty list is provided. The file `bug.py` shows the original buggy code that doesn't account for this, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.  The solution includes a check to handle the empty list scenario gracefully.
